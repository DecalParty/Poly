1.	Get a VPS in Amsterdam (~$5/mo)
2.	Clone & install on the VPS
3.	Create .env.local with 2 lines (private key + funder address)
4.	npm run build && npm start
5.	Hit "Test Connections" — all green → switch to Live
Nothing to enter in the bot UI. Everything goes in .env.local on the VPS. The bot reads it automatically.
